# oc-secure-your-web-application

This repository contains my code on OpenClassRoom course ["Secure your Web application with spring security"](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5683681-secure-your-web-application-with-spring-security) .

Since the course is such a mess, I've tried to implements something with sens and which works.
